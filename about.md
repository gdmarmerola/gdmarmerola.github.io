Hi! My name is **Guilherme Duarte Marmerola**, and I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil. I graduated in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english) and discovered the world of machine learning in an internship at [NICTA](https://www.data61.csiro.au/) (now called Data61) during an exchange program in Australia in my early undergraduate years. Since then, I've become increasingly passionate about ML and built many advanced analytics initiaves in the media, mining, insurance, retail, consumer goods and banking industries.

I hold a special interest about some specific topics:

1. **Reinforcement Learning:** particurlarly, I'm interested in the exporation-exploitation dilemma, and how to solve it with (bayesian) models that capture uncertainty. I'm devoting a lot of time to the study of bandit problems, and how to use them as frameworks to fundamental problems in industry (pricing, applying treatments, deciding which data to collect, etc.).

2. **Dimensionality reduction and clustering:** how can we visualize and interpret structure in our data, aiming to explain it to business stakeholders? Can we do better than simple K-Means clustering? What similarity measures, algorithms and representations would make this possible?

3. **Management, and data science in a business context:** doing data science in industry is far from trivial as we need to balance time for experimentation with deadlines, data is oftentimes messy and stakeholders may not have a clear understanding of our work and challenges. How can you deliver real value from ML, while creating and maintaining some of the best people motivated?

I hope I can bring useful insights about these topics and others. Feel free to [contact me](https://gdmarmerola.github.io/contact), and also add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdmarmerola/)!
